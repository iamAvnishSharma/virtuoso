		Virtuoso Privacy Statement
	</div>

	<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"> Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data Virtuoso processes, how Virtuoso processes it, and for what purposes.</div>

	<div style="padding-top: 20px; font-size: 20px;">Virtuoso offers a wide range of products, including server products used to help operate enterprises worldwide, devices you use in your home, software that students use at school, and services developers use to create and host what’s next. References to Virtuoso products in this statement include Virtuoso services, websites, apps, software, servers, and devices.</div>

	<div style="padding-top: 20px; font-size: 20px;">Please read the product-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional relevant information. This statement applies to the interactions Virtuoso has with you and the Virtuoso products listed below, as well as other Virtuoso products that display this statement.</div>

	<div style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">
		Personal data we collect
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">
		Virtuoso collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Virtuoso and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.</div>

<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">If you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Virtuoso, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data.</div>

<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"> You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.

	<div style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">
		How we use personal data
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">
		Virtuoso uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to:
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul style="font-size:20px; padding-top: 20px; list-style-type: disc;">
			<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>
			<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>
			<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>
			<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>

		</ul>
	</div>

<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</div>

<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"> In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Virtuoso products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.
	</div>


<div style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">
		Reasons we share personal data
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">
		We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Virtuoso-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Virtuoso and its customers.</div>


<div style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 30px;">
		How to access and control your personal data

			<li>Control the use of your data for interest-based advertising from Virtuoso by visiting our opt-out page.</li>
			<li>Choose whether you wish to receive promotional emails, SMS messages, telephone calls, and postal mail from Virtuoso.</li>
			<li>Access and clear some of your data through the Virtuoso privacy dashboard.</li>

		</ul>
	</div>

	<div style="padding-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;">
		Not all personal data processed by Virtuoso can be accessed or controlled via the tools above.
